> I would happily pay five times for this product!
> What really sold me on this was Bulk Edit. My assistant does not have to do any complex math now (earlier, I always feared she would make a mistake)! With Smart Manager, she has more free time at hand, hence I asked her to set up autoresponder emails for our customers. The response was phenomenal. Our repeat sales were up by 19.5%.

> **This software is indispensable!**
> It is possible to operate in bulk on anything: categories, attributes, tags, moving products from one category to another...
> We had a problem and support walked us through the resolution, even creating a software update to test the resolution.
> **In 20 years of working on the web, I have never found an assistance that does not abandon you and does not attribute the problem to other causes.**
> – Lolopo

> **A massive time saver...flawless export!**
> We have over 6000 individual lines on our site and this has saved us huge amounts of time.
> Bulk edit works flawlessly, which is a massive time saver. If you need to change all of your prices on the entire site by a % or value, you can with a couple of clicks! We updated the Tax > class on all products in less than 3 minutes. The CSV export tool actually works unlike some I have tried, with all 6000 odd lines neatly exported in one attempt. No missing or corrupt data.
> – Kevin Goodchild, Obsolete Electronic Components

> **You won’t find a better plugin for bulk edits!**
