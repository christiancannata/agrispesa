**1. Selectively Bulk Edit Wallet Balance**
You can credit and debit value into customers' wallets selectively. From the user list, you can choose any number of users in bulk and edit their wallet balance as you need. This will allow you to target and nurture users as a part of your marketing campaign or penalize them.

**2. Refund Through Wallet or Payment Gateways**
You can refund the value of purchased products & services directly into customers' wallets. A full or partial refund can be made to their WooCommerce wallets. In case of a partial refund, you can send the remaining refund balance using your payment gateways.  

**3. Adding Balance to Wallet Account**
Customers can add balance to their wallets using the available payment methods on the WooCommerce store. Merchants can also recharge or deduct their customers’ wallets in bulk or individually. 

**4. Select Partial Payment Option**
You can enable customers to use their WooCommerce wallet balance to pay for products in two different ways: Total Wallet Amount and Manual Wallet Amount. They can use the whole wallet balance while making a purchase. Or manually select to pay a partial payment of their choice.

**5. Download Transaction History [Admin]**
You can download the transaction history in a PDF file from the Wallet Transaction tab with a single click. It will contain the following data: Name, Email, Role, Amount, Payment Method, Details, Transaction ID, and Date. It will contain the entire transaction history in a tabular format. 

**6. Automatic Wallet Top-up**
You can create a daily or weekly top-up subscription plan to recharge customers' wallets automatically. And customers are free to select the top-up subscription amount. The user can’t do regular recharge when this wallet top-up subscription is enabled. Also, a new subscription will be created on every recharge in the middle of the subscription interval. 

**7. Wallet Recharge Orders**
The Wallet Recharge Orders sub-menu is added to the WooCommerce section upon the wallet plugin activation. It contains the list of recharges or top-up orders made by your customers that you have to approve manually. You can filter this list by status. 

**8. Wallet Balance Withdrawal** 
Customers can file a withdrawal request to withdraw their wallet balance into their bank account or other payment applications. The merchant has the power to approve or reject these requests in the wallet Withdrawal tab, but they have to address each request individually. The request table will also show the username and profile link.

**9. Email Notifications**
The Merchant can allow customers to review email notifications on the wallet recharge, the WooCommerce customer credit, and the deduction of the wallet balance. It will update your customers about their wallets. 

**10. Flexible Payment Option**
Customers can use their WooCommerce Wallets as a payment option if the wallet balance is higher than the total cart value. They can use it as a partial payment option when the wallet balance is lower than the total cart value.

**11. Transaction History [User]**
The customers’ wallet transactions history contains entries for wallet recharge, debit, credit, transfer, and withdrawal. The merchant can also see edits they’ve made to customers’ wallet accounts and the list of customers’ transactions.

**12. Wallet Amount Transfer**
The customers can transfer their wallet amount into other customers’ wallets. It will help the merchants increase user interaction on their WooCommerce store and result in an increase in the wallet user base.

**13. Wallet Cashback Reward** 
The Wallet system for Woocommerce allows you to send cashback rewards to customers in their WooCommerce wallets. Even if the payment method used to purchase the product is other than the wallet plugin, customers will still receive cashback rewards. You can set the cashback type as percentage or fixed and offer it cart-wise or category-wise. 

**14. Credit Amount on Daily User Visit, Commenting, and Sign Up**
Our digital wallet plugin allows you to implement a WooCommerce credit system. You can decide a daily login reward amount and enable your customers to earn wallet credit daily by simply logging in to their wallets. 

You can also let them earn wallet credit for submitting product reviews. For this feature, you can set the limit on how many comments a user can have per post, credit amount, and customize comment label text.

Lastly, allow your users to receive wallet credit upon signing up for the wallet system. Set the signup reward amount and description that is shown to the users on signup.
