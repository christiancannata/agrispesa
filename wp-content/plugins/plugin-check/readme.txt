Plugin Check is a WordPress.org tool which provides checks to help plugins meet the directory requirements and follow various best practices.

== Description ==

Plugin Check is a tool for testing whether your plugin meets the required standards for the WordPress.org plugin directory. With this plugin you will be able to run most of the checks used for new submissions, and check if your plugin meets the requirements.

Additionally, the tool flags violations or concerns around plugin development best practices, from basic requirements like correct usage of internationalization functions to accessibility, performance, and security best practices.

The checks can be run either using the WP Admin user interface or WP-CLI:

* To check a plugin using WP Admin, please navigate to the _Tools > Plugin Check_ menu. You need to be able to manage plugins on your site in order to access that screen.
* To check a plugin using WP-CLI, please use the `wp plugin check` command. For example, to check the "Hello Dolly" plugin: `wp plugin check hello.php`
    * Note that by default when using WP-CLI, only static checks can be executed. In order to also include runtime checks, a workaround is currently necessary using the `--require` argument of WP-CLI, to manually load the `cli.php` file within the plugin checker directory before WordPress is loaded. For example: `wp plugin check hello.php --require=./wp-content/plugins/plugin-check/cli.php`
    * You could use arbitrary path or URL to check a plugin. For example, to check a plugin from a URL: `wp plugin check https://example.com/plugin.zip` or to check a plugin from a path: `wp plugin check /path/to/plugin`

The checks are grouped into several categories, so that you can customize which kinds of checks you would like to run on a plugin.

Keep in mind that this plugin is not a replacement for the manual review process, but it will help you speed up the process of getting your plugin approved for the WordPress.org plugin repository, and it will also help you avoid some common mistakes.

Even if you do not intend to host your plugin in the WordPress.org directory, you are encouraged to use Plugin Check so that your plugin follows the base requirements and best practices for WordPress plugins.

== Installation ==

= Installation from within WordPress =

1. Visit **Plugins > Add New**.
2. Search for **Plugin Check**.
3. Install and activate the Plugin Check plugin.

= Manual installation =

1. Upload the entire `plugin-check` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Visit **Plugins**.
3. Activate the Plugin Check plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I contribute to the plugin? =

All development for this plugin is handled via [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check/) any issues or pull requests should be posted there.

= What if the plugin reports something that's correct as an "error" or "warning"? =

We strive to write a plugin in a way that minimizes false positives but if you find one, please report it in the GitHub repo. For certain false positives, such as those detected by PHPCodeSniffer, you may be able to annotate the code to ignore the specific problem for a specific line.

= Why does it flag something as bad? =

It's not flagging "bad" things, as such. Plugin Check is designed to be a non-perfect way to test for compliance with the [Plugin Review guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/performing-reviews/review-checklist/), as well as additional plugin development best practices in accessibility, performance, security and other areas. Not all plugins must adhere to these guidelines. The purpose of the checking tool is to ensure that plugins uploaded to the [central WordPress.org plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) meet the latest standards of WordPress plugin and will work on a wide variety of sites.

Many sites use custom plugins, and that's perfectly okay. But plugins that are intended for use on many different kinds of sites by the public need to have a certain minimum level of capabilities, in order to ensure proper functioning in many different environments. The Plugin Review guidelines are created with that goal in mind.

This plugin checker is not perfect, and never will be. It is only a tool to help plugin authors, or anybody else who wants to make their plugin more capable. All plugins submitted to WordPress.org are hand-reviewed by a team of experts. The automated plugin checker is meant to be a useful tool only, not an absolute system of measurement.

= Does a plugin need to pass all checks to be approved in the WordPress.org plugin directory? =

To be approved in the WordPress.org plugin directory, a plugin must typically pass all checks in the "Plugin repo" category. Other checks are additional and may not be required to pass.

In any case, passing the checks in this tool likely helps to achieve a smooth plugin review process, but is no guarantee that a plugin will be approved in the WordPress.org plugin directory.
