== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the login form missing on the checkout page? =
Make sure to enable the `Display returning customer login reminder on the "Checkout" page` option on the `WP Admin -> WooCommerce -> Settings -> Accounts` page

= Is the plugin GDPR compatible? =
The plugin doesn't add any cookies and it doesn't modify/add/delete any of the form fields. It simply reorganizes the checkout form into steps.

= My checkout page still isn't multi-step, though the plugin is activated =
Make sure to purge the cache from any of the caching plugins, or of reverse proxy services (for example CloudFlare) you're using.

Another possible cause could be that the checkout page isn't using the default [woocommerce_checkout] shortcode. For example, the Elementor Pro checkout element replaces the default [woocommerce_checkout] shortcode with its HTML counterpart. Go to the "WP Admin -> Pages" page, open the checkout page for editing and make sure the [woocommerce_checkout] is present there.
