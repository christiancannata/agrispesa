== Frequently Asked Questions == 
<h4>I can't see the CMP landing page I've just activated!</h4>
<p>As long as you're logged in as admin, you cannot see it. That`s the purpose of our plugin - it displays Maintenance or Coming Soon page only to guest visitors of your page while you can work on your real website. You can preview the page by clicking on "preview" tab, by logging out from Wordpress or accessing your website from a different browser (or anonymous tab)</p>

<h4>I can still see the landing page I've just deactivated! I even deleted the plugin but it is still there!</h4>
<p>This is 100% caching issue! Please make sure to delete cache from your caching plugins, hosting provider cache and browser as well. CMP plugin supports all most popular caching plugins, but sometimes it just does not work as expected and you still need to delete it manually in caching plugin option.</p>

<h4>I love the landing page so much, can I use it forever?</h4>
<p>Yes of course! You can use CMP landing pages as your main splash page! Just make sure to set CMP plugin to "Coming Soon & Landing Page" mode which returns correct response codes to web search engines.</p>

<h4>How can I translate text on buttons, countdown text and others?</h4>
<p>Go to CMP Settings  > CMP Translation sub-menu where you can translate or modify every string used!</p>

<h4>What are 503 or 200 HTTP codes, huh?</h4>
<p>OK, it`s easy - if you want to display Coming Soon page you usually wants to search engines (like Google) to be able to index your website. In that case you want the response code set to 200 HTTP "OK" - set Coming Soon mode or Landing Page.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you have your website already up and running but you are doing only a short maintenance it is better to send response 503 HTTP Service Unavailable code. By that way you make sure the search engines do not index your temporarily website while it's down for a short maintenance and do not lower your website SEO score.</p>

<h4>Is it a bug? No one likes BUGS! How can I report it?</h4>
<p>This is awkward and shame on us:(. Fortunately we are friendly guys and if you let us know about it on WordPress Support Forum we promise to fix it as soon as possible!</p>

<h4>I have a perfect idea for new features!</h4>
<p>That's great! We are happy to hear about any feature or idea you might have to make our plugin perfect! Just let us know <a href="https://niteothemes.com">NiteoThemes website</a> and we will discuss it!</p>


<h4>I really love your plugin and I want to support it!</h4>
<p>Nothing is better than a good feedback! Please go to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cmp-coming-soon-maintenance/reviews/">Plugin reviews</a> and rate it! Alternatively you can click on a Donate button too!:)</p>
