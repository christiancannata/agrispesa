Provides a simple interface for administrators and shop managers, help them to navigate through WooCommerce Orders inside order edit screen, without the need to get back to the order listing screen proceed to the next order and lost track and time.

It is simple but really a time saving app.
Imagine you have 200 orders to process after a busy day and you need to continuously keep track of the order you've just processed in your mind, so you know which order you going to edit after you return to order's listing screen. Easy? Guess again.

That's in the past with our plugin.
With two discreet buttons ( Next Order, Previous Order ) in a very convenient area under the update order button, you can save the trouble and get busy
with something else.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your website and activate it
2. That's it! Now go to WooCommerce / Orders, edit an order and observe the new handy buttons under the update button.
