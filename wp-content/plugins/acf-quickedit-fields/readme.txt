Enable Columns, Filters, Quick Edit and Bulk Edit for ACF Fields in WordPress List Tables

== Description ==

WordPress plugin which adds Quick Edit functionality to Advanced Custom Fields Plugin ([Pro](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) and [Free 5+](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/).

= Features =
 - Show ACF field values in List views
   [Supported ACF Fields](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields/wiki/Feature-Support-Matrix#supported-acf-fields).
 - Supports Post, Term and User list tables
 - Scalar Columns (Like Text, Number, ...) can be made sortable
 - Edit ACF Field values in Quick edit and Bulk edit

= Usage =

#### In the Fieldgroup editor:

**Column View:**

 - *Show Column* will sho a column in the WP List Table.

 - *Sortable Column* will make the column sortable. This only works with primitive Field types like Text, Number, Range and so on.

 - *Column weight* gives you an option to take control of the column order. The higher the weight, the more to the right the column will be. Present columns will have defaults weights of multiples of 100 starting with zero for the checkbox column. For example to place an image column between the checkbox (column weight = 0) and title (column weight = 100) choose a value between 0 and 100.

 - *Filter* add a filter to the posts users or terms list.

**Editing**

Toggle *QuickEdit* and *Bulk Edit* to enable Editing in the List table view.

**Location Rules**

The plugin follows ACFs location rule logic as far as possible. If you have a field group that is only applies to posts in a specific category or with a certain post starus, then columns and quick edit will only show up, if you have filtered the posts by that category ar post status.

**Conditional Logic**

Conditional logic is not supported.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= When will you support the Non-ACF Field XYZ? =

Presumbly I won't. However, there are some [plugin filters and actions](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields/wiki/Plugin-Filters) that might come in handy, if you decide to write an implementation by yourself.

I even wrote a [tutorial page](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields/wiki/Tutorial:-Custom-Field-Integration) on how to write our own field type integration.

= I'm having trouble. =

Please use the issues section in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields/issues). A well described issue that can be reproduced quickly is more likely to be fixed quickly.

I will most likely not maintain the support forum on wordpress.org. Anyway, other users might have an answer for you, so it's worth a shot.

= I'm having trouble with WooCommerce. =

Welcome to the world of commerce.

If you are located in the EU, you can [hire me](https://flyingletters.net) for the usual market price of an IT guy in central europe.

Outside the EU you can try to fix it yourself or find someone who does. I will likely accept well crafted and tested pull request in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields).

= I'd like to suggest a feature. Where should I post it? =

Please post an issue in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quickedit-fields/issues)
