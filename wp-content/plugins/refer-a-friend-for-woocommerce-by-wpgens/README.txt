Referral System for WooCommerce. Each customer has referral link that rewards them with a coupon after someone makes a purchase through their link

== Description ==

### Increase your store sales through Word Of Mouth, by having people promote your products to their friends. ###

Compatible with WooCommerce from 2.4 and above, including the latest 7.x version of WooCommerce.

This plugin will create a simple but powerful referral system on your website. Instead of giving money to your referrals, you are rewarding them with coupons that they can use to get discounts when buying on your website, or even free products, depending on a coupon settings. Free version comes packed with lots of features, <a href="https://wpgens.com/downloads/refer-a-friend-for-woocommerce-premium/" rel="friend" title="RAF">premium version has shortcodes, coupons for friends and a couple more options.</a>

The plugin will create a unique link for each of your members, link that is visible on their account page. Members can use this referral link to invite people to your site, and every time someone comes to your site through their link and makes a purchase, you will reward them with a coupon. Simple as that.

= Coupons Are Connected With WooCoupons. This Allows You To: =

* set the value of each coupon;
* define the type of the coupon;
* define the minimum order;
* determine whether the coupon is product specific or not; (PREMIUM only)
* set a coupon expiry date; (PREMIUM only)
* award coupon to a friend as well; (PREMIUM only)

After order is marked as complete, coupon is sent to a person who referred you a customers. Every time referral receives a coupon, it will be shown on his account page and only he can use it.

As with our other plugins, refer a friend is coded with best practice, it is super light and will not slow down your site.

**Coupons are created only once order is marked as complete, to prevent abuse.**
