WooCommerce Unit Of Measure allows you to add a unit of measure, or any text after the price of a WooCommerce product.

== Description ==
WooCommerce Unit Of Measure allows you to add a unit of measure (UOM), or any text you require after the price in WooCommerce.

= Requires WooCommerce to be installed. =

== Installation ==
1. Upload WooCommerce Unit Of Measure to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Inventory" tab in the product data area and put in your unit of measure
4. Publish or update your product
5. That's it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where will the unit of measure output on the product? =
After the price.

= Can I add a unit of measure to a simple or variation product? =
Yes you can. At this stage you can not change the unit of measure per variation but you can add a "global" (displays on all variations) like unit for the product.

= Can I upload the unit of measure text when with WooCommerce CSV Import Suite? =
Yes you can, follow these steps:
- Add a column to your Import Product CSV document
- Add the following title to your new column, meta:_woo_uom_input
- Fill your column with your required unit of measure or whatever text you want to add after the price for your product

= Will this work with my theme? =
Hard to say really, so many themes to test so little time.
