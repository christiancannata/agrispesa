= NOTE: INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN ALONE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SITE GDPR AND CCPA COMPLIANT. SINCE EACH SITE USES DIFFERENT COOKIES, YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU HAVE THE NECESSARY CONFIGURATIONS IN PLACE WITH A SUPPORTING COOKIE NOTICE. = 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is GDPR? =
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the EU privacy law that protects personal data and regulates how organizations handle it. It is also referred to as DSGVO (DatenSchutz-Grundverordnung) in German.

= What is CCPA? =
CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). It gives residents more control over personal data, requiring transparency, opt-out options, and secure handling.

= What is GDPR cookie consent? =
Under GDPR, sites must get explicit consent before storing or accessing non-essential cookies (analytics, ads). This is called GDPR cookie consent.

= What is CCPA compliance? =
CCPA compliance means meeting the law’s privacy requirements, including informing users about data collection, offering opt-out mechanisms like “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and ensuring secure processing of user data for CCPA cookie compliance.

= What is a GDPR plugin and why do I need one for WordPress? =
A GDPR plugin manages cookie consent, blocks cookies until consent, and generates cookie/privacy policies. CookieYes’s GDPR WordPress plugin automates these tasks for WordPress.

= What does this plugin do? =
CookieYes adds a cookie banner to your site, informs visitors about your cookie policy, and helps you log and manage consent. It also lets you list cookies on your policy page using a shortcode (or HTML if connected to the Web App).

Yes. CookieYes supports both GDPR and CCPA/CPRA compliance, including GDPR cookie consent and  CCPA cookie consent features. You can add banners and CCPA opt-out links.

= Can I customize the cookie notice using CookieYes? =
Yes. Adjust banner text, layout, style, and position. Premium plans allow logo upload and branding removal.

= Does the plugin block cookies before consent? =
Yes. Non-essential cookies are blocked until explicit consent; essential cookies run by default.

= Do visitors have to accept or refuse cookies to use a website? =
No. Only essential cookies load by default. Users may accept or reject other cookie categories.

= Does this plugin stop all cookies from being stored? =
It blocks cookies based on category consent. However, if another plugin places cookies outside of CookieYes, we cannot control or guarantee those behaviors. Blocking everything forcefully could break your site, so this plugin aims to balance compliance with usability.

It scans and categorizes cookies, provides banners and preference centers, and logs/export consent data for audits.

= Is CookieYes a reliable cookie consent tool for GDPR compliance? =

Yes. Built-in generator creates Cookie Policy and Privacy Policy pages from scan results.

= Does CookieYes support multilingual websites? =
Yes. CookieYes automatically translates the banner into over 30 languages based on the visitor’s browser. It also supports WPML and Polylang for multilingual WordPress setups.

= Do I still need a privacy policy if I use CookieYes? =
Yes. A privacy policy is legally required. CookieYes helps you generate one, but you must ensure that it accurately reflects your site’s data practices.

= Is CookieYes suitable for large websites or agencies? =
Yes. CookieYes includes features like subdomain consent sharing, multi-user management, and scheduled cookie scans. It also supports login-protected page scanning, which makes it a good fit for large and enterprise-level sites.

Yes, CookieYes integrates with [WP Consent API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api), allowing it to share user consent states with compatible plugins and improve compliance consistency.

= The cookie notice header does not work on my browser. What should I do? =
Please report the issue on the support forum. Include:
* Your website URL
* WordPress version (bottom right corner of your dashboard)
* The browser where the issue occurs (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

The more details you share, the faster we can help.
